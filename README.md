# Lab19_API

## Challenge
Starting from an empty MVC template, Create an API that allows a user to Create individual ToDo tasks, and put them in a ToDoList. Create an API in .NET Core that conducts the standard HTTP verbs (Get,Put,Post,Delete) for a “To-Do” list.

The “To-Do” list will consist of individual tasks that can be saved into the database and extracted as needed. It should also have the ability to get all of the tasks by a simple get request. 

Use Postman (in addition to unit tests) to test your endpoints.
